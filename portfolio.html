                        <p>A healthcare network needed to expand access to care, especially for patients in remote areas. They required a secure, HIPAA-compliant platform for virtual consultations. Patients in rural communities were traveling long distances for routine appointments, and the network wanted to improve access while maintaining the highest standards of patient privacy and security.</p>
